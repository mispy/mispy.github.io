                <p>Twitter is pretty important to me. I'm a very quiet person, and it provides a pleasantly low-expectation way of interacting with a bunch of interesting humans (and robots?) that I wouldn't really have otherwise. Over the years, I have seen troubled people find acceptance, the formation of strong friendships and romances, and the activist power of many voices in unison. I have had opportunities to help others solve interesting problems and many people have helped me. Also there are a lot of puns. So many puns.</p>

<p>The social architecture of Twitter is flat and centers around individuals. Anyone can follow anyone; the largest corporation account and the shyest of teens are all mechanically more-or-less identical. Twitter has no real concept of a <em>group</em> or a <em>topic</em>, just a whole bunch of people and a few searching functions like hashtags and mutes.</p>

<p>While this flatness can be very empowering, especially in a political context, I have found it also makes certain kinds of social behavior difficult. When you follow someone on Twitter you are committing to see <em>everything</em> they say unless it is specifically directed to another account that you don't follow. For example, if I follow some brilliant programmer with obnoxious political views I must spend an awful lot of time rolling my eyes as they wax lyrical about the wonders of Ayn Rand and the horrors of millenial entitlement in order to read about interesting experiences with type systems. (I don't actually follow anyone like this, fortunately.)</p>

<p>The way I tweet about stuff myself is also affected. I mostly discuss programming, video games and sometimes ethics or demography. People who follow me do so under the expectation that there will be more of such things. Sometimes, however, I find I am really interested in something else! What if I am reading a book on the <a href="https://twitter.com/m1sp/status/622773586504212480">history of the Byzantine Empire</a> and want to talk lots about the theological controversy of the Council of Chalcedon? Or just squee about cute anime boys? I end up self-censoring a lot, because at least one of those 2000 or so people is going to be bored by <em>one</em> of those things and there isn't really a way for them to opt out aside from opting out of <em>me</em> entirely.</p>

<p>So I find myself wanting a place on the internet aside from just Twitter, one which has something closer to a traditional forum architecture where the focus is more on particular groups or topics than individuals. In a network based on threads or channels nobody has to look at the contents of any particular topic, so they can be as deep or niche as they like without bothering anyone else. Maybe freenode, or even Reddit?</p>
