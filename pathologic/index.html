      <section class="post-content">
        <p>I'm playing as the Haruspex this time. He is the son of Isidor Burakh, and has returned to the turn to see his father before he dies. Sadly, looks like he has already passed, and I have been terribly slandered as a murderer. I start out hungry, thirsty, injured and with low reputation. The letter from my father suggests that Vlad Olgimsky is the person to turn to.</p>

<p>Notkin, a child in a small gang refuge, says that Bad Grief is the kingpin of the criminal world and has a lair in the northern Warehouses. He assumed I was working for him.</p>

<p>Lika betrayed these kids and stole their medicine, just as a war is about to break out with the Dogheads. Apparently the Dogheads are much larger than this gang. Lika hid in the Steppe before vanishing entirely. They lost him near the barrow. Notkin suggests one must never hurt dogs.</p>

<p>I killed the doghead and one other guy who was chasing me. PROBABLY NOT SO WISE</p>

<p>Went to Vlad's house, had to take out some more people along the way. It seems he won't be back until 11pm. I think it is currently 9:46? How do I check time? Ah, it's on the character screen. I found an unlocked door, however, with his daughter inside (Victoria, also known as Capella). She claims that the world will collapse and be reborn in two weeks.</p>

<p>Took some Meradorm and slept at Victoria's place for 6 hours. Health is now back up to about half and exhaustion is gone, but hunger is very high indeed. Time to talk to Vlad!</p>

<p>Vlad says that Katerina, Alexander Saburov's wife, has precognitive abilities and foresaw many horrors related to me. Vlad says I should go speak to the doctor who just arrived, and that I should talk to his daughter. And to avoid killing any more random people on the street. >_></p>

<p>Capella says that there are Bound kids who can help me find out how my father spent his last evening. She knows only that he went off into the Steppe for a very long time and came back late last night. Apparently the children visited my father so much because they were dying.</p>

<p>I've received my list of Bound people, all kids: Murky, Sticky, Notkin, Grace, Capella herself, Taya Tycheek and Khan.</p>

<p>Grace lives in a small lodge at the cemetery. The cemetery is in Earth, to the southwest of the Abattoir.</p>

<p>Capella says that danger awaits me at the Cemetery, the Warehouses and in the Steppe today. I should not go there today at all. So no visiting Grace, I suppose.</p>

<p>She tells me I can't go back to Isidor's house, in the middle of the Tanners district. It is filled with Saburov's men, and I must wait until the matter is settled with her father (Vlad). Her father says that his son, Vladislav Jr., is currently staying in a building on the outskirts of town.</p>

<p>Vlad the Younger tells me I will inherit a dangerous obligation along with my inheritance. He also tells me to get to know Bad Grief if I want access to resources.</p>

<p>Bad Grief says there is only one person from the Station that isn't dead yet, who can describe my features. He crawled off to the cemetery. Should I go finish him off? I don't want to kill anyone if I can avoid it though, and Capella specifically told me not to go to the Cemetery because evil would result.</p>

<p>...crap, I just realized she told me not to go to the warehouses either. I shouldn't be dealing with Bad Grief at all. Let's go somewhere else. Ideally to find food!</p>

<p>I've gone to speak to Notkin. I'm not sure if this area counts as the warehouses, but I don't have any other leads... apparently people are saying a shabnak killed my father, a maneater from the Steppe made of bones. They found a monster's claw stuck in his chest.</p>

<p>On the night of his death, Notkin saw him but he was chased off. Apparently some guy with a revolver is looking for me, went to Grief. That's the warehouses... hmmm.</p>

<p>I met the Bachelor at Eva Yan's house. He was hunting me all day, but discovered that I'm innocent because Simon died of a contagious disease.</p>

<p>Ended up dying of hunger, hrrm. Perhaps I was wrong in my assessment of Capella's warning? And I'm supposed to go to those places anyway, just be cautious for wrong decisions there?</p>
