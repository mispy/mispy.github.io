      <h1 class="post-title">Nicawelema and the Mercenary Queen</h1>

      <section class="post-content">
        <p>I once tried writing down my thoughts from an adventure mode game of Dwarf Fortress, without worrying about uh... narrative quality. The result:</p>

<hr />

<p>Nicawelema was a loose collective of forest dwellings and jungle cities brought together by a pressing need to defend themselves against an increasingly hostile world. Queen Ameli had fended off attacks by horrors, trolls, titans and human empires for the past hundred years, and she had grown more than a little tired of it.</p>

<p>Ameli had realized that the immortal elves would need to put aside their pride and learn to understand the younger races if they were to survive. She sent out a call for the bravest of her kin, to leave the safety of the canopy and venture into the world. "Seek allies among the dwarves," she said, "for they are among the few who are not already bitter enemies."</p>

<p>And so it was that I began the adventure, striking out from my home in Howlclans towards the distant mountains.</p>

<p>I stopped briefly in Blossomedflaxen, our easternmost settlement which had yet to be razed by some doom beast. A woodcrafter there told me of how they had barely avoided the threat of forest titans and giant rocs. I had half a mind to pursue them myself, but I could find no warriors willing to join me, and I was not so confident in my sword arm that I would face such creatures alone. </p>

<p>The woodcrafter knew little of the dwarves, but rumor held that they lived in the Perplexing Hills, across the eastern mountains. It would be a long, cumbersome trek through the snow, and the people here had little to spare. I would have to survive on melted snow and what little wild game braved the winter, and hope fate would protect me against those things which haunted the night.</p>

<p>Come morning, I set out for the foothills. Food proved easier to find than I expected; these mountains were practically teeming with life. The howls of the great wolverines struck fear into my heart, but they did not take me for prey. Perhaps they sensed the importance of my mission.</p>

<p>I had brought no bow, knowing that only so many elvish arrows could be found outside my homeland. Instead, I feasted on hoary marmots and other small animals slowed by the frost, sneaking up on them and sinking my dagger into their hearts. A quick, respectful death.</p>

<p>The frosted peaks soon gave way to even more unfamiliar terrain: dunes of clay, blood-red as far as the eye could see. I encountered strange flocks of birds in the shape of men. They seemed peaceful, but uncomfortable with my presence, and I had little luck communicating. I decided to move on.</p>

<p>Nightfall brought with it glimpses of terrors in the dark, and I dared not make camp. With the last rays of the sun I stumbled across a new pattern in the clay, stretching forwards... a road! Could it be that the dwarves were closer than I had thought? I clung to that road like a creeper vine and ran as fast as I could.</p>

<p>The sounds of deep, laughing voices drew my attention from the dark. <br />
 Sure enough, I had found them! I flew forwards into a small mound and dozens of bewildered dwarven eyes turned to stare. After a moment, a capable-looking lady dwarf greeted me and offered a place to sleep. I nearly fainted from relief. What a first impression to make!</p>

<p>Dawn brought with it questions, so many questions. I learned that the woman who saved me was named Minkot, and she commanded the militia here in Sensedwheel. The dwarves had a mighty civilization, stretching across much of the land. They were not without their own troubles, however; Minkot's own son had been kidnapped by goblins. Nicawelema encountered goblins rarely, and it seemed we had the dwarves to thank for engaging the bulk of their horde.</p>

<p>Minkot sympathized with our plight but had little to offer other than hospitality. She found my estimations of her authority amusing, noting that she was little more than a military envoy assigned to a tiny hillock. Tiny! It had seemed vast to me. To seek a true alliance with the dwarves, I would have to travel to the great fortress of Twistedearths, the size of which I could scarcely imagine.</p>

<p>The mayor and sheriff told me much the same thing. They were not willing to risk the defense of the hillock by sending anyone to accompany me. I decided to stay for a time and learn more about these people before setting out for the capital.</p>

<p>While unwilling to provide any men, the dwarves of Sensedwheel were very forthcoming with material support. A hunter named Ablel provided me with a mighty crossbow and some bolts in exchange for a few marmots. Minkot gave me access to the militia's armor stores, including a beautiful leather cloak engraved with bone and silk.</p>

<p>I spent many nights in the tavern, getting to know the commoners of the hillock. Many of them had lost family and were drowning their sorrows in drink. Some, upon hearing my tale, leaped at the chance for vengeance and swore to accompany me to the capital. I didn't exactly trust these drunken farmers to be any good in a fight, but I signed them on anyway.</p>

<p>One evening a new dwarf came to the tavern, one quite unlike the others. He drank not in vast gulps but in sips, and his eyes glinted of steel. I approached, cautiously, but the dwarf was first to speak!</p>

<p>"I hear you're lookin' for a guide to the capital, elf. I can help."</p>

<p>"Are you another lost soul out for vengeance? I have found many of those."</p>

<p>He smiled briefly and shifted. Layers of mail glinted from beneath his coat. "I am a soldier. Name is Tun Zefonetas."</p>

<p>Tun was a scout of the Ittasreg Legions, one of many dispatched to outlying regions to report on matters of interest to the Mercenary Queen. An elvish diplomat in search of allies would be one such matter.</p>

<p>My heart soared; straight to the queen herself! Doubt lingered, however. I feared that a ruler known as the Mercenary Queen would not be the sympathetic sort, and might demand much for military aid. After witnessing the tiny fraction of Twistedearths' technology and might present in this hillock, it was clear we had little to offer in return.</p>

<p>That was a matter I would worry about later. I had equipment and supplies, a small group of fervent farmers, and Tun. It was time to head for the fortress!</p>

<hr />

<p>Shortly after leaving, we passed a second hillock. None of the sounds of happy drunken dwarves could be heard from this one, only an eerie silence. Fearing the worst, I carefully entered a mound dwelling-- and a green shape leapt forth from the darkness, lunging at me with a fearsome halberd!</p>

<p>I rolled to the left, finding myself now cornered in the small space of the mound. A second goblin loomed behind the first, sword in hand, both armored in mail shirts and iron caps. They were between me and the exit and bearing down rapidly. I feared this would be my end.</p>

<p>The second goblin turned away from me suddenly, and raised his shield, just in time to save his life from a copper bolt. Tun! The goblin rushed outside to be set upon by my newfound allies, leaving me and the halberd-wielder to face each other.</p>

<p>A tense game of dodging and parrying continued for several moments as I danced around his weapon, delivering quick dagger strikes where I could. The halberd was clearly not designed for combat in close quarters, let alone against an agile combatant. It wasn't long before he slipped and my blade found its way into his arm.</p>

<p>The misshapen face gazed at me in disbelief as I snuffed out a goblin's life for the first time. I wonder now if he was as unfamiliar with elves as I was with his people, and if I would have survived otherwise.</p>

<p>The remaining swordsgoblin was no match for the six of us. Zuglar sustained minor injuries in the battle, and I gave him the halberd goblin's equipment as thanks. For myself, I claimed the silver scimitar and a set of armor.</p>

<p>"It's a snatcher detachment," Tun said. "The goblins raze villages and leave small groups behind to capture any straggling civilians. They're usually not heavily armed, we might be able to take them." He grinned.</p>

<p>I knew nothing of goblins and had just barely escaped from my first encounter alive. We had one marksdwarf scout, one farmer with stolen goblin equipment, three unarmed drunks and a very out of place bladedancer diplomat. I didn't much favor our chances of fighting professional soldiers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I wanted to prove Nicawalema's worth to the Mercenary Queen, recapturing a settlement from sworn enemies in her name sounded like an excellent start.</p>

<p>We caught many of the goblins while they were sleeping, Tun and I dropping silently into the mounds from above and picking them off with our crossbows. It wasn't long until we came across their leader, unarmed and begging for mercy. I wanted to question him, but the dwarves were having none of it; Zuglar's halberd was swinging before I could get a word out. The hatred between these people runs deep.</p>

<p>In the end, we lost one of the farmers; last I saw he was fleeing in terror, chased by an axegoblin. I hope he survived. The others proved their worth in battle and we came out of it a very different group to the one that went in, armed with captured goblin equipment and confident about our victory.</p>

<p>"Elena's Seekers!" Tun said.</p>

<p>I blinked. "Sorry?"</p>

<p>"A name, for our group. I think you've brought out the best in these people."</p>

<p>I tried to object, but Tun was having none of it. So it was that we resumed our journey to Twistedearths, bound together by our experiences.</p>

<hr />

<p>We arrived at the fortress entrance just before nightfall, weary and in need of a good bath. A vast road, wider than any artificial surface I'd yet seen, ran across the dry gulf of an empty river. Before I could marvel at the construction, however, a human came running across the bridge.</p>

<p>A human! Now those I had some experience with, and little of it positive. I hailed him down to investigate.</p>

<p>His name was Isi, and he claimed to be a member of the fortress guard, just returning from patrol. A human, guarding a dwarven settlement? Preposterous! I reached for my blade, but Tun quickly assured me that it was not uncommon; the Mercenary Queen attracted many turncoat soldiers from the Empires, weary of their fickle rulers. Isi said he would lead us into the fortress, and I followed warily.</p>

<p>[]</p>

<p>The greatest surprise of all was the goblins. Goblins, everywhere! At first I thought surely the fort must be under foreign occupation, but Tun and Isi laughed. The goblin practice of kidnapping and indoctrination had backfired, it seems; some dwarven children brought with them tales of the Mercenary Queen and her fondness for strength and freedom. Goblins value these things, and evil demon rulers do not often provide much of the latter.</p>

<p>I met many counts and countesses and various lords and ladies of the dwarven realms. I met Urvad, baroness of Sensedwheel, and even she was a goblin! I had not seen a single goblin in my time there. She explained that there was much residual resentment against goblins in the outer colonies, so despite her official title she preferred to let the dwarven population there largely govern themselves.</p>

<p>Indeed, Zuglar, Cog and Edem looked singularly uncomfortable here. Not a day ago we had lost one of our own to these green-skinned creatures, and here we were wining and dining with them. I was even more curious to meet this Mercenary Queen who could compel such harmony between races under her banner.</p>

<p>Isi introduced me to a fellow guard, a young spear-toting goblin named Bosa. She told me much of the Mercenary Queen, whose true name was Mistem Skystaff. The queen had been born to warriors in the hillocks of Crowdgild, to warrior parents. She was not born into her position, instead forging it through combat against the endless tides of night creatures.</p>

<p>It was through her brother Edzul that Mistem first learned of the goblins. Edzul was captured in a midnight raid and held prisoner for nine years until he finally managed to escape and return home. There, he told Mistem of how a goblin had helped him escape and died in the process, and how their society was ruled by a terrible demon tyrant.</p>

<p>As queen, Mistem pursued a policy of peace through power. Knowing he could not face her armies in open combat, the great demon Smug Mellowskirt instead unofficially sanctioned bandits to harrass and kidnap dwarves, disclaiming all responsibility. It was these we had fought at Hatchetsabres.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Twistedearths traded openly with with Silencemaligned and in so doing attracted more and more goblins to join their cause, slowly draining Mellowskirt of his bravest warriors.</p>

<p>A clever strategy, I thought, and perhaps it saved the most lives in the long run. My impression of the Mercenary Queen had changed drastically, though I now had another doubt to contend with: would such a non-interventionist monarch ever lend military aid to Nicawalema? I remembered the fury in Zuglar's eyes. Much is sacrificed, to maintain peace.</p>

<p>Still, the goblins were not an immediate threat to my people. And even the humans of the had never once conquered Blossomedflaxen, for all their bravado. No, what threatened our forests most were the great beasts. So many of our settlements had been lost to the dragons and rocs and titans, our people slain in the night by horrors. They could not be converted or reasoned with, and surely the Mercenary Queen must see that.</p>

<p>"Take me to her," I told Tun.</p>

<p>My meeting with the queen was... anticlimactic. I found her neither a terrifying warlord nor a savvy peaceseeker, but a tired woman trying her best to keep together a vast and fragile multiracial alliance which held itself together largely by inflating her own personality. She seemed at best patiently unamused by Bosa's admiration of her, and openly scornful of Isi's heritage in the Empires.</p>

<p>It would, she said, be a political impossibility to send soldiers to defend a tiny, obscure nation while the humans and goblins and monsters teemed at her own doorstep. There was little she could do.</p>

<p>I pleaded my case vehemently. "When they're done with us, they will turn your attention to you. This delicate balance with the goblin empires cannot hold if you are besieged on yet more fronts."</p>

<p>Tun spoke of my prowess in battle. "If all her people are like that, you wouldn't need many."</p>

<p>The Mercenary Queen sighed. "My people pride themselves on their freedom. I will not command my forces to do so, but let it be known that whoever chooses to aid the elf may do so with my blessing. Tun; go with her and make sure she does not become a menace." And with that, I was dismissed.</p>

<p>She had, in effect, given me permission to scavenge her forces for adventure-starved soldiers without fear of them being reprimanded for abandoning their posts. A pretty token gesture, but it was something.</p>

<p>I turned to my companions. "Well, there it is. You have my thanks for seeing me this far. I won't ask you to do more."</p>

<p>Isi and Bosa looked at each other. "Well, <em>we're</em> coming with you!" the goblin said. If she had been discouraged by her idol's dourness, it certainly didn't show on her face.</p>

<p>"My people have wronged both the elves and dwarves. I think I stand more chance of setting things right out there with you than guarding an already well-guarded fortress." Isi said.</p>

<p>"Edem, Cog? We will be going up against anything up to and including literal dragons. You're not soldiers; I can't ask this of you."</p>

<p>"There is little for us to go back to, Elena. We are Seekers now, first and foremost." Edem said. Cog just nodded her head and bowed.</p>

<p>"Well, now that's settled, where are we off to?" Tun, at least, was my one official asset.</p>

<p>"I figure if we want these people to come slay monstrosities with us, we need to prove we  know what we're doing first. Isi, is there a threat to Twistedearths the guard haven't been able to track down yet?"</p>

<p>"Quite a few. They use hit-and-run tactics to avoid the bulk of us. Our best bet is probably Nagnod Bloatperplexed the Infinite Conquerer, a minotaur sighted about a day's travel to the northeast."</p>

<p>And so we went looking for bullmen.</p>

<hr />

<p>A day's travel to the northeast took us close to the border with the Violent Empires. We passed a hamlet and I felt particularly uneasy. Sure enough, a crossbowman attacked us just as we were leaving-- I had no idea why, but Isi was visibly unnerved. I suspect they were hunting deserters.</p>

<p>I met another crossbowman, this time in an abandoned village. She had the temerity to announce she had slain six  elves in Blossomedflaxen! Her bravado was short-lived; as soon as Tun and I opened fire she began to run. We hunted her down and emptied our quivers, though not before she wounded poor Tun. </p>

<p>Much later I learned that the crossbowman's name was Pak, and she was the daughter of one of the Buff Empires' terrible necromancers. She had lost her ear in a duel with my own Queen Ameli. A good thing I had stopped her there, before she too wielded the fell arts!</p>

<p>Lady's daughter died at Blossomedflaxen, Elena attacks, Tun dies, The Swift Ivy is formed, all four hearthpeople, night monster in the village, supporters, night monster 2, bites Bosa, trying to keep Bosa alive, Bosa is scarred, slayed minotaur with Isi</p>

<p>Rescuing Minkot's child and the human tagalong to the great city</p>

<p>Triumphant return, slaying of the great forest titan</p>

<p>Elena eventually succumbed to bandits, after a successful campaign across much of the continent, slaying night creatures.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Mercenary Queen can no longer tolerate the constant goblin incursions. She commissions a small elite guard to counterstrike against the kidnappers, rescuing who they can. (but why does she hate me?)</p>

<p>They march upon Shieldcovered.</p>
