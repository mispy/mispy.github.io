<p><em>Note: This post is a work in progress! I add new stuff here as I come across it.</em></p>

<p>With no counteracting forces at work, a big isolated system like a planet moves towards maximum entropy, a uniform state which is kinda boring and sad. Life flourishes on the Earth because we do receive outside energy, in the form of the sun, a huge nigh-eternal beacon of happiness and warmth. All<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemosynthesis">almost all</a></sup> of the little creatures that live here are ultimately powered by photosynthesis at the base of our food chain.</p>

<p>I think hope is a similarly vital basic input to people. Fortunately, you don't need nuclear fusion for that: the actions of wonderful people across the world are generating reasons to hope all the time. This is my ongoing collection of sunshine, to remind myself and others that <a href="http://www.itgetsbetter.org/">It Gets Better</a>, not just for isolated individuals but eventually, gradually, tentatively, for everyone.</p>

<p>Main sources: <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/">Ignorance Project</a>, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx">Gallup Polls</a></p>

<p>Take a moment to consider the following question:</p>

<pre><code>In the last 30 years the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has...

A. almost doubled
B. more or less stayed the same
C. almost halved
</code></pre>

<p>If you answered C, congrats! Don't feel too badly if you would've said A or B though-- 95% of people in the US<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> don't know the answer.</p>

<p>If you aren't a US resident you might now be scoffing about ~Americans~ and their unlearnedness. In the UK, <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/news/highlights-from-ignorance-survey-in-the-uk/#.VDcehvmSyt8">twice as many</a> people know the answer! Which brings them to... well, a whole 90%. Even Sweden only manages 77%. I'm Australian and I certainly wouldn't have guessed correctly, before I started reading about this kind of stuff specifically.</p>

<p>The fact that it's not just a majority but such an overwhelming international supermajority is interesting to me. Some other US stats for comparison (2013-2014):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/170822/believe-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx">42% young earth creationists</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/168620/one-four-solidly-skeptical-global-warming.aspx">39% climate change skeptics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/166787/liberal-self-identification-edges-new-high-2013.aspx">38% identify as conservatives</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These are the kind of numbers you expect when educational issues skew along political lines and are subject to partisan meddling. By contrast, that 95% value suggests something deeper and more universal is going on. </p>

<p>This is weird because... things are actually getting better, for the most part?</p>

<p>Whether you consider the world as a whole a good or bad place is a pretty subjective question and depends on definitions of goodness and badness and what expectations you have and various other rabbit holes. I won't say that life is generally splendid because that's a bit disrespectful to people for whom it is often not (like uh, myself). My claim is more limited:</p>

<p><strong>Human society has made lots of recent progress towards unambiguously good things like peace and equality, and we tend to underestimate the extent of it.</strong></p>

<p>Now, <em>progress</em> does not mean that problems are solved or no longer important. If anything it means we should redouble our efforts, because it really is possible to make a difference!</p>

<p><a id="peace"></a>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the Cold War ended some 20 years ago, there has been a major decline in the number of armed conflicts being waged around the world, with high-intensity conflicts dropping by almost 80 percent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's hard to think of a human force more destructive and terrible than war between nations.</p>

<p><em>Hold on to that thought</em>. It's not a universal one, certainly not throughout history. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/20092010/graphs-and-tables.aspx"><img src="/content/images/2014/Aug/average-number-of-violent-conflicts-e1313935841485.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Vast empires and wars of conquest and colonization have been defining elements of human civilization for thousands of years, since the very beginning of recorded history. Since the Second World War, global culture has shifted such that this just <em>isn't done</em>. Wars still happen, but they are scarcer, and no longer about straightforward conquest and annexation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/20092010/graphs-and-tables.aspx"><img src="/content/images/2014/Aug/battledeaths.png" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Not only are there fewer wars, but the wars that do happen are much less deadly. The average annual average death toll per conflict is <a href="http://hsrgroup.org/docs/Publications/HSR20092010/20092010HumanSecurityReport-Part2-ShrinkingCostsOfWar.pdf">less than 10%</a> what it was in the 1950s. The advent of nuclear weapons saw the peak of technological destructive capability, and despite all the political tension of the Cold War there was not a single exchange of WMDs.</p>

<p><a href="http://fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/publications1/TrimmingNuclearExcess.pdf"><img src="/content/images/2014/Aug/nuclearstockpiles.png" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>In the early 90s, South Africa <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=M7wIryQK6UkC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">dismantled its entire nuclear arsenal</a>, becoming the first country in history to do so. Whether we want to get rid of nuclear weapons entirely is a matter of some debate, due to their deterrence effect, but the fact that nations no longer perceive such a need for them can only be good.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/20092010/graphs-and-tables.aspx"><img src="/content/images/2014/Aug/battle-deaths.png" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Basically, we just don't kill each other that much anymore!</p>

<p>So why does it sometimes seem like there's more violence and danger than ever? I suspect we're just a lot more aware of it, whether as a result of the cultural context following 9/11 or the development of new forms of news media. The positive side of which is that it is hard to conduct military operations of significant size with any kind of secrecy. Covering up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War_Crimes_Working_Group">war crimes committed in Vietnam</a> would be a difficult task in the presence of the internet.</p>

<p>Death is the great equalizer, the heart of evolution and ecosystems, weeding out the weak and leaving only those strong enough to crawl their way to survival. But you know what? Screw death and evolution; we have love and kindness, and we have no need to care for the same notions of strength and weakness as a blind, uncaring physical system.</p>

<p>War isn't the only big problem we've been tackling effectively. People just don't die as much in general, primarily due to <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6024a4.htm">massive improvements in public health around the world</a>. The worldwide average life expectancy at birth is projected to rise to 73 in 2025, compared to just 48 in 1955.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/child-mortality/#child-mortality-globally-post-1950"><img src="/content/images/2014/Aug/childmortalityrate.png" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Early childhood is the most risky time for humans. Without fully developed bodies and immune systems, kids are especially vulnerable to threats such as undernutrition and infectious diseases. We've gotten pretty good at keeping them alive and well: the decade between 2001-2010 saw an increase in the survival rate to age 5 by <em><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6024a4.htm">2 million children per year</a></em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/#world-maps-of-life-expectancy-in-1800-1950-and-2011-max-roserref"><img src="/content/images/2014/Aug/lifeexpect2-1.png" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>This is one of those cases where the beauty of global development is truly apparent. Improvements in medicine and healthcare haven't been limited to some tiny handful of privileged groups; literally <em>every country in the world</em> is a safer place to live than it was 200 years ago.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that about 51.2% of the decrease in child mortality is directly attributable to <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61257-3/abstract">global improvements in gender equality and the education of women</a>. This is one of the greatest global victories of feminism.</p>

Fears of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_catastrophe">Malthusian catastrophe</a> are fifty years out of date: the growth rate has been <a href="http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#growthrate">decreasing since the 1960s</a>, and is projected to stabilize in 2062 with around 10 billion humans.

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index">Human Development Index</a> (HDI) measures a combination of life expectancy, education and living standards for a country.

<p>The history of human<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals">and non-human</a></sup> societies is filled with all kinds of diverse and wonderful ways of experiencing gender, love and sexuality, far beyond the simplistic chromosomal binary and reproductive unions. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)">Hijra</a> of both ancient and modern India include individuals close to the common conception of transgender women as well as more nonbinary forms of gender identity. Records dating back to 1700 BC make mention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_lesbianism">women marrying women</a>, and the ancient city-state of Thebes had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Band_of_Thebes">entire army troop of male lovers</a>.</p>

<p>Vast forces of cultural normativity have tried to suppress this diversity. The <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/mutation-helps-create-the-most-durable-religions">power of literacy and doctrine</a> helped Islam and Christianity spread quickly, crushing many of the more tolerant ritual-based belief systems. And later when the British Empire began its aggressive colonization of the planet in the pursuit of tea and racism, it brought with it Victorian morality, leading to cases like the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9162941/British-Raj-Victorian-prudery-to-blame-for-Indian-gay-sex-ban.html">outlawing of gay sex in India</a>. </p>

<p>The good news is that the forces of historical imperialism and technological development have also left us with a world that is more culturally unified and interconnected than ever before. This means we have the potential to alter norms on a global basis and hopefully, eventually, rid the world of this kind of bigotry forever, or at least contain and marginalize it.</p>

<p><a href="http://equaldex.com/"><img src="/content/images/2014/Aug/changelegalgender.png" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>I mention transgender rights first, because these have historically been the most ignored: the poor little final letter in LGBT which is related to but ultimately quite different to the others. Even here though, there's been a lot of progress! </p>

<p>The Egyptian pyramids were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/pyramid_builders_01.shtml">not built by slaves</a> as is commonly believed; thousands of skilled, salaried workers were involved. Still, the amount of manual labor involved was immense, and it's hard to imagine that this is how everyone would choose to spend their time, given the choice. How many talented people throughout history have had to put aside their own dreams in service of existing power structures? And how many wonderful creations have been lost to us as a result?</p>

<p>In modern industrial societies, we have cultural products that are analogous to the pyramids in some sense. Economies of scale lead to it being more profitable to produce and distribute a small number of very popular works of art in place of a large number of more niche ones: blockbuster movies and best-selling novels. People expend a lot of time and energy, and especially <em>attention</em>, on these.</p>

<p>In some ways this can be good, because it means we have widely shared cultural reference points: I can talk about Legolas or Pikachu and be pretty confident you know who I mean. On the other hand, for every Lord of the Rings there are thousands of more diverse fantasy novels (which may even, you know, have women in them) that don't get read because they're just not in bookstores. How do we fix this?</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/long-tail-open-source"><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/long_tail.jpg" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Fortunately, getting people into obscure stuff is something the internet is very good at. Online retailers, and especially online publishers, are not limited by the same economics as their traditional counterparts. The above chart shows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long tail distribution</a> towards which the online economy moves: when it becomes very easy to sell a new <em>kind</em> of thing, the most popular works no longer represent quite as large a portion of overall sales.</p>

<p><a href="http://changethis.com/manifesto/show/10.LongTail"><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/longtail.png" alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Of Amazon's book sales, somewhere around <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/10/objection_1.html">25-30% are niche works</a>. This is especially meaningful to me because two of my best friends, <a href="http://0xabad1dea.github.io/">Melissa</a> and <a href="http://press.invincible.ink/">Talen</a>, are authors who publish works of fiction online. While they might have been able to distribute their novels through traditional channels, it certainly wouldn't have been as easy for them-- and some culturally vital elements like queer characters may not have survived intact.</p>

<p>Aside from aiding less popular creations, the internet also has a way of making it easier for less established groups to achieve popularity. The above image shows the <a href="http://www.flurry.com/bid/82758/Indie-Game-Makers-Dominate-iOS-and-Android">dominance of new developers</a> over traditional publishers when it comes to mobile games, distribution power having been equalized by the relative accessibility of app stores. Even if some of those games are, well, Flappy Bird.</p>

<p>Finally, the benefits of new technology do not go solely to new creations. Digitization projects like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Books">Google Books</a> and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> preserve access to all manner of mysterious ancient tomes, in a form that makes them much easier to find and reference than traditional libraries. With luck, the entire concept of "out of print" will soon become obsolete; we need never again see a great loss of human thought like the burning of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>.</p>
