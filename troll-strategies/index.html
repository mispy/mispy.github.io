      <section class="post-content">
        <p>I've generally encountered three types of people on the internet who will engage me unprompted in an irritating way.</p>

<p><strong>Type A</strong> - Knows they are being annoying and actually just wants to annoy you. Classic troll type.</p>

<p><strong>Type B</strong> - Clueless kind, doesn't realize that they're annoying. Often these are ESL speakers.</p>

<p><strong>Type C</strong> - Knows that you consider their behavior annoying but thinks you are being unfair or oversensitive because they believe they would not be annoyed if someone treated them in this way. Tends to be petulant.</p>

<p>How should I deal with these people? I think first we should consider what kind of goal we have in interacting with them at all. Often it is simply to make them go away, which is perfectly legitimate. However I also have some other goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to avoid hurting them more than is necessary, especially since I do not know how vulnerable they may be.</li>
<li>I would like to also discourage them from harrassing <em>other</em> people.</li>
<li>In cases of ideological conflict, I would like to discourage further polarization and (if at all possible) plant seeds that allow them to later change their mind about a subject.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Type A</strong> - Outright trolls tend to be about dehumanization and othering. They do not recognize you as an individual, do not believe you are capable of affording them respect (as you are part of the Evil Team), and so will give none to you. Responding with sincerity and patience to these people can sometimes shame them into normal human interaction as they must resolve the cognitive dissonance between your kindness and their image of you.</p>

<p><strong>Type B</strong> - The most important thing here is that a Type B can be easily converted into a Type C if they are treated with excessive hostility. I think the best approach is to combine engagement with gentle rebuke-- talk to them about the subject, but also point out that there are better ways to approach people. This combination of positive and negative feedback makes them more likely to accept the criticism rather than activating their defensiveness.</p>

<p><strong>Type C</strong> - These are the ones I am least sure how to deal with. Since they already have a meta belief structure about what is appropriate to consider appropriate as well as what is appropriate, almost any action you take is likely to induce polarization. I think it is probably easier to avoid creating these people than it is to handle them once they are around.</p>
