        <p>Reviewing some of our experience and Mispy Policy, I think these are the criteria for the kind of job you want:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Long-term</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Or, at least, of potentially indefinite duration. The main reason for this is that you aren't very good at dealing with unemployment, both in the literal and psychological sense: you tend to just procrastinate until your savings are depleted by food and rent before being driven to action again.</p>

<p>A corollary to this is that you can't expect an employer to keep paying you unless they have an extant and working business model. Favor reasonably established organizations; no weird startups!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Socially meaningful</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can't afford to be <em>too</em> fussy on this one, but there's definitely room to be more than you have been in the past. A reasonable standard: to be worth working for, an organization must either engage primarily in activities which have a clear benefit to humanity, or do things that are personally meaningful to you and the people you love.</p>

<p>Do we want to do more <strong>gamedev</strong>? I think consider this on a case-by-case basis but don't make it a primary focus. The artistic fulfillment that comes from making games seems easier to pursue in your own time than the social fulfillment that comes from making useful stuff. i.e. I find it easier to envision doing webdev for worthy causes as a career and making games as a hobby than the inverse.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Low-to-medium responsibility</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing in the world makes you feel worse than failing to live up to people's expectations. On the other hand, not having <em>any</em> responsibility also makes you miserable. Favor jobs where it matters if you do things, but it's not the total end of the world if you don't do something. Particularly, stay away from ops and customer-facing stuff where screwing up can mean immediate problems for everyone else.</p>

<p>Similarly, you need <em>some</em> degree of flexibility in work schedule because you will inevitably miss stuff, but too much of it just enables bad habits.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Remote..?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you get a decent <strong>remote</strong> job it would be very easy to just move to Perth and hang out with Anzie. A local one may serve a similar function in terms of social development, though, and either way you'd be better equipped to visit. You could always get a job <em>in</em> Perth but it's a smaller city and the options are more limited.</p>

<p>If you do get a remote job, you will have to enforce some kind of physical routine of your own, because the psychological separation-of-concerns function served by commuting (and simply being outside in general) seems important to you.</p>

<h4 id="possibilities">Possibilities</h4>

<p><strong>Khan Academy</strong> - <a href="https://twitter.com/ariabuckles">@ariabuckles</a> works here and suggested it last time I was looking. An educational non-profit is exactly the kind of thing I would be happy to work for, and they may value a developer with a background in science. The only problem is it's <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers">not actually clear</a> if they're still hiring programmers (or if they hire remote people-- I ain't moving to California). Should definitely email Aria about it, at the very least.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong> - <a href="https://twitter.com/charliesome">@charliesome</a> lives in Melbourne and works here. The company has had issues in the past, but I suspect my influence in that regard could be a positive one. And they do make gamergaters mad by banning their repos. The product I'm pretty positive about-- I've seen more contributions and introductions to programming via github from more diverse people than anything that existed in the past. It's just <em>really useful</em> to me and lots of people I know.</p>

<p>Not many of the current <a href="https://jobs.github.com/positions/dbc38234-5036-11e5-8cde-8b87832ac9a0">listed openings</a> fit me especially well; a lot of them are customer-facing or high-responsibility devops things. but <a href="https://jobs.github.com/positions/5fc7989e-510a-11e5-9813-258e790f18b2">https://jobs.github.com/positions/5fc7989e-510a-11e5-9813-258e790f18b2</a> looks pretty promising!</p>
