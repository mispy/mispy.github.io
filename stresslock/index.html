      <section class="post-content">
        <p>This is a key symptom to my experience of mental illness, but I've never been able to match it adequately to an existing psych concept, so I might just define it myself.</p>

<p><em>Stresslock</em> is a hybrid physical/mental feeling of tension, which has the effect of inhibiting behavior and thought. It varies in intensity, with the highest levels causing complete paralysis, sometimes for hours. The subjective experience is extremely unpleasant: it's something like wanting to scream, but finding you no longer have a voice or indeed a body at all.</p>

<p>The earliest memory I have of a stresslock paralysis state is somewhere around grades 4-5. My parents had settled on a joint custody arrangement where I would alternate weeks between houses. At the time, I strongly preferred living with my mother, which led to Thursday nights and Friday mornings at her place being emotionally taxing affairs for everyone involved.</p>

<p>One particular Thursday night I was sent to bed after the usual protestations, but I did not fall asleep. Nor did I get up. I just <em>laid</em> there, for <em>hours</em>, feeling utterly awful and yet completely unable to move. Eventually I started crying loudly enough that my step-father noticed, for which I am grateful.</p>

<p>Stresslock has several triggers, but the most consistent is the combination of <em>social expectation</em> and <em>uncertainty</em>. At one point in my life I somehow got roped into trying a threesome. This was, of course, an utter disaster because I went into maximum stresslock for hours and very nearly ended up jumping off a balcony. (don't ask how but I ended up trying <em>again</em>, with the same result. scientific reproducibility!)</p>

<p>Paralysis states are thankfully rare, but minor stresslock is an everyday problem. I will sometimes drop out of online conversations because someone asked "how are you?" and I don't know how to respond. Compliments can stresslock me, because they express an expectation of goodness on my part that I don't feel I can live up to. This makes interaction difficult.</p>

<p>The distinction I draw between stresslock and anxiety is that it has a very specific effect: I just <em>stop</em>. It's not about blushing, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath. I stop everything I am doing and can't do any more of it or think about it and that's the end of it. Often I will just go to sleep because it's pointless trying to do anything else. Troublesome!</p>
